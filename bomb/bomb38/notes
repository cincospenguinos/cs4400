* explode_bomb is probably the function that reports a failure. Set a breakpoint there
* The second phase requires six integers
  - The first needs to be non-negative
  - The second must be 2
  - The function loads the six integers into an array, whose address is at %rbp
  - It looks like the function checks to see if the current number is twice the previous
  - The second password is 1 2 4 7 11 16
* The third phase requires an int, a char, and an int --> just three args
