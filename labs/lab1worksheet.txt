CS4400 Spring 2017 Lab1 Worksheet:

1. Copy your simple C program below.

#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
  printf("hello world\n");
  return 0;
}

2. What is the index in to the argv array of the first argument you passed to your program?

/* TODO: What is this question asking? */

3. What is the first string in the argv array?

The name of the executable.

4. What is printed? Is this what you expect? What does this tell you about the data type of the “name” variable?

The bash variable for the command line argument that was passed ($1), the memory address of the
string, and the value of the string. For the command `./hello_to Joey`, I got the following
output:

$1 = 0x7fffffffe717 "Joey"

5. What is printed by “x/6c name”?

0x7fffffffe717: 65 'A'  108 'l' 105 'i' 99 'c'  101 'e' 0 '\000'

6. By how much did the address change after adding 2 to it?

The address changed by two - it became 0x7fffffffe719.

7. What does this tell you about the size of the data type (char) that “name” points to?

The data type char is a single byte.

8. If we had a variable “x” of type int*, and we execute the statement x += 2, by how much would the value of “x” change?

The value of x would change by 8 - that is, the address stored in the variable x automatically moves over by two * size of
an integer.
